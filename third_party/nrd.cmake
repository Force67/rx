# NVIDIA NRD real time denoiser, downloaded via tools/get_nrd.sh and built from
# source. Consumed through the direct Vulkan path (no NRI): the engine reads the
# embedded SPIR-V pipelines from nrd::GetInstanceDesc and records the dispatches
# itself (see engine/render/denoiser_nrd.cc).
#
# NRD's CMake pulls MathLib and ShaderMake through FetchContent. The nix build
# configures with FETCHCONTENT_FULLY_DISCONNECTED, so both are vendored next to
# NRD and redirected here. ShaderMake would otherwise also download DXC from
# GitHub; SHADERMAKE_FIND_DXC is forced off so it finds the dev shell dxc (which
# already produces the engine's own SPIR-V) on PATH instead.
